# Project Title

This project scraps the data of coins of Augustus (Octavian) from the years 44BC to 14 AD from the British Museum website. In doing so, we can explore any relationships of the inscriptions, denomination, material, date, subjects, associated names and weight.

## Getting Started

Simply run the code in Analyze Data.ipynb to see the relationships

## Counts Plots
These stacked bar plots show the number of coins from [SOURCE] with each bar representing the number of coins produced
by each authority/emperor/emperor(s) on coin ordered chronologically. Each bar is stacked by the number of coins made of each material.
### By Authority
* [allData](Plots/allData_TotalCount_authority.html)
* [americanNumismaticSociety](Plots/americanNumismaticSociety_TotalCount_authority.html)
* [britishMuseum](Plots/britishMuseum_TotalCount_authority.html)
* [OCRE](Plots/OCRE_TotalCount_authority.html)
### By Emperor
* [allData](Plots/allData_TotalCount_emperor.html)
* [americanNumismaticSociety](Plots/americanNumismaticSociety_TotalCount_emperor.html)
* [britishMuseum](Plots/britishMuseum_TotalCount_emperor.html)
* [OCRE](Plots/OCRE_TotalCount_emperor.html)
### By Emperor Displayed

* [OCRE](Plots/OCRE_TotalCount_emperorDisplayed.html)


## Select Words Comparison Plots
These stacked plots compare the counts of each word, stacked by material, in the obverse/description from each source.
### On Obverse
* [allData](Plots/allData_.html)
* [americanNumismaticSociety](Plots/americanNumismaticSociety_.html)
* [britishMuseum](Plots/britishMuseum_.html)

* [OCRE](Plots/OCRE_.html)


## Counts and Ratio of Select Words
These stacked bar plots show the number/ratio of coins from [SOURCE] with each 
bar representing the number of coins produced containing the [WORD] crown by 
each authority/emperor/emperor(s) displayed ordered chronologically. Each bar 
of the count plots is stacked by the number of coins made of each material. We
determine if a coin "contains" the word if the word is in the description except
for "radiate." For "radiate," we check the obverse and not the description.

## Coin Distribution Over Time Plots 
These plots show the number of coins produced by Augustus/Constantine ordered chronologically and show the mint locations of the
coins. We only counted the estimated starting production year and only counted coins that had an estimated production 
years of five years or less.
